Advanced math simulator for learning the multiplication table up to 20.

.exe file is in the /dist/

This is just a draft of the basic version. A final version with a nice GUI will be added later.

Thanks to my kids for the idea!



*Reminder for me: pyinstaller -F --icon=calculator.ico --name=multiplication_trainer_v.0.2 main.py
