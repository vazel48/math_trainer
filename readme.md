Advanced math simulator for learning the multiplication table up to 20.
Addition and subtraction were added in version 0.3

.exe file is in the /dist/

This is just a draft of the basic version. A final version with a nice GUI will be added later.
Thanks to my kids for the idea!


* Reminder for me: pyinstaller -F --icon=calculator.ico --name=math_trainer_v.0.3 main.py
